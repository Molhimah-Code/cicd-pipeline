# üîí Complete Code Protection & Approval Setup Guide

Based on [GitHub's CI/CD solution](https://github.com/solutions/use-case/ci-cd), this guide ensures developers cannot affect production code until properly approved.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Protection Layers Implemented**

### **1. Branch Protection Rules**
- **main**: 2 approvals + code owner review + all checks must pass
- **staging**: 1 approval + code owner review + quality checks
- **develop**: 1 approval + basic checks
- **hotfix**: Emergency access with admin approval

### **2. Required Status Checks**
- ‚úÖ Code Quality Gate (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- ‚úÖ Security Gate (npm audit, CodeQL, secret detection)
- ‚úÖ Testing Gate (unit tests, integration tests, coverage)
- ‚úÖ Build Gate (application build verification)

### **3. Code Owner Reviews**
- **Critical files**: Require multiple approvals
- **Infrastructure**: DevOps team approval required
- **Security**: Security team approval required
- **Source code**: Team approval required

### **4. Environment Protection**
- **Production**: Manual approval required
- **Staging**: Auto-deploy with branch policies
- **Development**: Open for testing

## üöÄ **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Run Branch Protection Setup**

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup-branch-protection.sh

# Run the setup (replace with your GitHub token)
./setup-branch-protection.sh YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### **Step 2: Configure GitHub Environments**

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Environments"
3. Create these environments:
   - **production** (with protection rules)
   - **staging** (with branch policies)

### **Step 3: Set Up Required Secrets**

Add these secrets to your repository:

```bash
# Required secrets
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_url
CODECOV_TOKEN=your_codecov_token
```

### **Step 4: Test the Protection**

1. **Create a test branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-protection
   git push origin test-protection
   ```

2. **Create a pull request**:
   - Go to GitHub
   - Create PR from `test-protection` to `main`
   - Verify all checks run

3. **Test approval workflow**:
   - Try to merge without approvals
   - Verify it's blocked
   - Add required approvals
   - Verify merge is allowed

## üîê **How Protection Works**

### **Developer Workflow**

1. **Developer creates feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   # Make changes
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request**:
   - All automated checks run
   - Code quality, security, tests, build verified
   - PR cannot be merged until all checks pass

3. **Code Review Process**:
   - Required reviewers are automatically assigned
   - Code owners must approve changes
   - At least 1-2 approvals required (depending on branch)

4. **Merge Protection**:
   - Cannot merge until all requirements met
   - Cannot force push to protected branches
   - Cannot delete protected branches

### **Production Deployment**

1. **Automatic triggers**:
   - Push to `main` ‚Üí triggers production deployment
   - Manual workflow dispatch ‚Üí manual deployment

2. **Approval gates**:
   - Pre-deployment validation
   - Manual approval required
   - Environment protection rules

3. **Deployment process**:
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Security scanning
   - Performance checks
   - Manual approval
   - Production deployment
   - Post-deployment verification

## üìä **Protection Status Dashboard**

### **Branch Protection Status**
- ‚úÖ **main**: Fully protected (2 approvals + all checks)
- ‚úÖ **staging**: Protected (1 approval + quality checks)
- ‚úÖ **develop**: Basic protection (1 approval)
- ‚úÖ **hotfix**: Emergency protection (admin approval)

### **Required Checks Status**
- ‚úÖ **Code Quality Gate**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript
- ‚úÖ **Security Gate**: npm audit, CodeQL, secret detection
- ‚úÖ **Testing Gate**: Unit tests, integration tests, coverage
- ‚úÖ **Build Gate**: Application build verification

### **Environment Protection Status**
- ‚úÖ **Production**: Manual approval required
- ‚úÖ **Staging**: Auto-deploy with policies
- ‚úÖ **Development**: Open for testing

## üö® **Emergency Procedures**

### **Hotfix Process**
1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Make critical fix
3. Create PR to main
4. Admin approval required
5. Deploy to production

### **Bypass Protection** (Admin Only)
- Only repository admins can bypass protection
- All bypasses are logged
- Requires justification

## üìà **Monitoring & Alerts**

### **Deployment Notifications**
- Slack notifications for all deployments
- Email alerts for production deployments
- Dashboard updates for status changes

### **Security Alerts**
- Failed security scans
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Secret detection alerts
- Code quality issues

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **PR cannot be merged**:
   - Check all required checks are passing
   - Verify required approvals are given
   - Ensure code owner reviews are complete

2. **Deployment blocked**:
   - Check environment protection rules
   - Verify manual approval is given
   - Ensure all pre-deployment checks pass

3. **Status checks failing**:
   - Review check logs
   - Fix code quality issues
   - Address security vulnerabilities
   - Ensure tests pass

### **Getting Help**

- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Review branch protection settings
- Contact DevOps team for deployment issues
- Contact security team for security issues
